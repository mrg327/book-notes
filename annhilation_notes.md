# Annihilation Notes 



In the black water with the sun shining at midnight, those fruit shall come ripe and in the darkness of that which is golden shall split open to reveal the revelation of the fatal softness in the earth. The shadows of the abyss are like the petals of a monstrous flower that shall blossom within the skull and expand the mind beyond what any man can bear, but whether it decays under the earth or above on green fields, or out to sea or in the very air, all shall come to revelation, and to revel, in the knowledge of the strangling fruitâ€”and the hand of the sinner shall rejoice, for there is no sin in shadow or in light that the seeds of the dead cannot forgive. And there shall be in the planting in the shadows a grace and a mercy from which shall blossom dark flowers, and their teeth shall devour and sustain and herald the passing of an age. That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated it shall walk the world in the bliss of not-knowing. And then there shall be a fire that knows the naming of you, and in the presence of the strangling fruit, its dark flame shall acquire every part of you that remains."



"Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner 
I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness 
and surround the world with the power of their lives 
while from the dim lit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be 
writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been."

Chapter 1

I like the spooky nature of the area.

The word of the book is uncanny.

The encounter with the boar was also very interesting, how as it got closer, it became less recognizable 

Descending into the "tower" was also very cool.

Obviously the writing on the wall is ominous, but is there any actual meaning?

Everything was some kind of microorganism which I think was very cool.


Chapter 2

The murder of the anthropologist was unexpected.

The betrayal by the psychologist was also kind of expected but not to the degree that she did

The intrigue of the lighthouse is also very interesting: who is up there?

The repetition of the term "tower" is also very interesting: why does the biologist feel the need to call it this?

What role does the "old" technology play in their exploration? Is it required or just an experimental variable?

I am eager to hear about what the biologist finds going off on her own.


Book Club 1 Questions:

How big is area X?

How tall is the tower?

Biologist and husband sex????
